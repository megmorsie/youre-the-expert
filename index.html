					<h3>Being The One-Woman Show</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Expected to Know About a Ton of Topics</p>
					<p class="fragment">Can Become a Spiral</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<small>As devs in general, we're expected to know... <br />
						but that gets heightened at a smaller company.<br />
						Best thing = be honest &amp; tell co-workers if you need time to look into something... It helps with timelines - instead of saying you'll get something done by next week, tell them you'll look into it by next week.<br />
						My example of a project that almost spiraled out of control... Multisite I launched in Dec - Customizer API, giant database, xferring data from CodeIgniter. Staying til 7pm w/ 45 min drive.</small>
